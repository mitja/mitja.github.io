I am an IT Solution Designer at T-Systems International GmbH, specializing in Kubernetes and Cloud-Native Application Operation.

Beside my full-time role, I build AI apps and am currently updating my book [Hands-On ChatGPT in Excel](/posts/hands-on-chatgpt-in-excel/). 

I enjoy sharing my knowledge on this blog and in person. If you are interested in AI Engineering training or coaching, please send me a [mail](mailto:hi@mitjamartini.com).
