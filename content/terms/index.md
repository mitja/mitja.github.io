## General Terms

I develop AI SaaS applications and am currently working on a course on this topic.

After some research, I decided to use the [Bitkom standard terms and conditions](https://bitkom-consult.de/muster-agb). In my view, they provide a fair and well-balanced foundation for defining specific terms for the use of my SaaS applications and additional services.

* [General Terms](allgemeine-geschaftsbedingungen-av-bitkom-en.pdf) (AV)
* [Services](dienstleistung-dl-bitkom-en.pdf) (DL)
* [Software as a Service](nutzung-von-software-as-a-service-saas-en.pdf) (SaaS)
* [Software development](erstellung-von-individualsoftware-ves-bitkom-en.pdf) (VES)
* [Software maintenance](pflege-von-standardsoftware-vps-bitkom-en.pdf) (VPS)
* [Software license](uberlassung-von-standardsoftware-vu-bitkom-en.pdf) (VU)
* [Work contract](werkvertrag-wv-bitkom-en.pdf) (WV)
* [Hardware and/or software rental](miete-von-hard-undoder-software-vm-bitkom-en.pdf) (VM)

## Refund Policy

**SaaS Applications**

My SaaS applications can be tested **free of charge for 30 days – no credit card required**. During this period, you can explore all features at your own pace and decide whether the product is right for you. If you choose not to continue, no costs will be incurred.

**Courses & Digital Content**

For courses and digital content, a **full refund** is available as long as **no more than approximately one third of the material** has been accessed. This gives you sufficient time to get a genuine impression of the course.

**Fairness**

Beyond these rules, the following applies:

If you have a **valid reason** and are dissatisfied, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I am generally **fair, flexible, and solution-oriented**, and I’m happy to find a reasonable solution.

If you have any questions or would like to request a refund, you can contact me at any time at
**[hi@mitjamartini.com](mailto:hi@mitjamartini.com)**.
