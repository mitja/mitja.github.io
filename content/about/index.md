Hi, I’m Mitja Martini,

I work as IT Solution Designer at T-Systems International GmbH. 

On the side, I build AI SaaS apps and work on a course about it.

My goal is to use AI responsibly, safely, and in ways that create measuable value.

I believe in learning by doing. If you want to turn prompts into reusable applications or 
create a small-scale prototype of a SaaS idea, I can help you get there, quickly and in a structured way.

If you are interested in learning to build AI SaaS apps, please check out my upcoming course [Ship a SaaS in 3 Weeks](https://promptflower.com).
