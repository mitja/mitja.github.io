Hi, I’m Mitja Martini,

I work as IT Solution Designer at T-Systems International GmbH. 

On the side, I build AI Apps and update my book "Hands-on ChatGPT in Excel".

My goal is to make AI approachable, efficient, and useful for businesses.

I believe in learning by doing. If you want to turn prompts into reusable applications or 
create a small-scale prototype of a SaaS idea, I can help you get there, quickly and in 
a structured way.

What I help with:

* Getting started with no-code AI tools and spreadsheet-driven workflows (mainly Excel)
* Building AI-powered web apps in Python (Django, FastAPI, FastHTML, Litestar, Streamlit, ...)
* Building Voice AI solutions
* Improving AI systems through error analysis and evaluation
* Getting started with AI-assisted coding
* Setting up local AI environments
