title: The Fast Solopreneur
---

In [The Batch 300](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-300/), Andrew Ng shared some insights about the importance of speed for startups and how to move fast as a startup. I think they apply well to ideas for a fast solopreneur:

- Focus on one idea,
- Code prototypes intuitively,
- Be creative about getting user feedback quickly (it doesn't have to scale),
- Pivot quickly but stay within your domain,
- Use a KISS stack you know, and 
- Learn AI technology well.

Here is a summary of Andrew's original perspective:

- Focus on a concrete idea (don't get distracted)
- Switch quickly to another hypothesis when data shows that the original hypothesis is flawed
- Trust a domain expert's gut instinct
- Build and test prototypes quickly with AI-assisted coding
- Be fast at getting user feedback (this becomes the bottleneck and the competitive advantage)
- Know the technology well (a deep understanding of what AI is good at and what it isn't saves time and avoids dead ends)
