In case you haven't tried vibe coding, recently, you should probably try it (again). Their performance has increased quite a bit thanks to recent models like Opus 4.5. Here are some recent takes on vibe coding:

> Everyone's talking about vibe coding without looking at code. I was skeptical.
> I decided to give it a shot on a challenging problem and was blown away by what 
> I could accomplish in 8 hours. 
> I'm not skeptical anymore, but I also do NOT think it kills SaaS. 
> 
> -- Hamel Husain on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97hYbaVCJ74)

> I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed 
> agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not 
> everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it 
> generated what we built last year in an hour.

> I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being 
> dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are 
> increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more 
> powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over 
> the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill 
> issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master [...] Clearly 
> some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and 
> everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting 
> magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession.

> Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.
