When I was young, I thought of senior engineers, consultants, etc. as experts that are more effective. My assumption was that seniors work harder to get there and be senior.

Now that I'm older, I realize: Being efficient is as important and probably more distintctive than being effective: I need to be calm, save time, and work efficiently to achieve the goals in a relaxed way, as I don't have as much energy anymore and because time feels much more precious.

Being senior is all about simplifying.
