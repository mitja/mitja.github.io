When I was young, I thought of senior engineers, consultants, etc. as experts that are more effective. My assumption was that seniors work harder to get there and be senior.

Now that I'm older and have "senior" in my job title, I realize: Being efficient is as important and probably more distintctive than being effective: I need to be calm, safe time, work efficiently to achieve the goals in a relaxed way, as I don't have as much energy anymore and because time feels much more precious.

Being senior is all about simplifying.
