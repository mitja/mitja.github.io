Today I learned about [Rashid's](https://rashidazarang.com) solution to export ChatGPT conversations to Markdown or even PDF if you like. I prefer Markdown as I can use it to continue the conversation with Claude for example, or change the content and use it in other contexts.

You don't need to install anything because it's just a JavaScript snippet. You open the conversation in a browser, select anything in the conversation, inspect it with developer tools and use the console to paste and run the JavaScript snippet and then the Markdown gets downloaded. It's really simple and extremely helpful in my view.
