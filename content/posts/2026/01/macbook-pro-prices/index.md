Let’s take a look at Macs instead. Out of curiosity, I included my current system in the first row (using its refurbished price), along with potential replacements. Interestingly, for roughly the same price I paid almost three years ago, I would now end up with a system that is either slower or less ergonomic (for example, a smaller screen). This is probably what it feels like when Moore’s Law starts to run out of steam.
