title: Developing Small Python Scripts with Claude Code
---
Claude Code is really very good at developing small Python scripts. That’s super practical and a good way to get to know Claude Code better. Here’s how I developed two scripts with Cloud-Code.

How do I proceed? 

First, it’s super important to describe exactly what you want and under what constraints you want it. In my example, I used the following prompt:

The prompt already contains information about the programming language (`Python`), the package manager (`uv`) and the AI framework (`Pydantic AI`.

Later on, I noticed that it uses the wrong version of Palentic AI. That has happened to me quite often. I then corrected it by providing documentation for the new version.

Right, and the script—the translation script—evolved a bit over the course of the session. I then took several steps to improve it, and I think it’s quite good now.

If you then review the steps again to see what you should pack into the prompt next time so that it works well right from the start, nonetheless, despite these hiccups.
