After reading a nice post [via HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44147966) about [On Stepping Back](https://rjp.io/blog/2025-05-31-stepping-back), I habitually scrolled through the comments and found this nugget by [evrimoztamur](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=evrimoztamur):

> Interacting with LLM coding tools is much like playing a slot machine, it grabs and chokeholds your gambling instincts. You're rolling dice for the perfect result without much thought.

This probably applies to many systems that use Generative AI, especially systems that work on the cutting edge where randomness is more pronounced.

If you also "[Can't sleep gud anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq6a3WC5_Ns)" as Mario Zechner beautifully put it, be aware that coding with agents can be addictive.
