For documentation, I prefer Sphinx over static site builders like Hugo and Jekyll, as I can

- have one source for html, epub, and PDFs,
- create docs from Jupyter Notebooks with [Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/),
- write in markdown with [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.17.1/sphinx/intro.html), and
- use book-like features such as index, glossary, bibliography, footnotes, and figure captions.

A disadvantage of Sphinx is that smaller documentations often look a bit empty with the most common themes for html. 

Today, I stumbled across the [Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) Sphinx theme. I like that it looks good with a minimal, customizable appearance and that it looks good even with small documentations.

I think I'll give it a try.
