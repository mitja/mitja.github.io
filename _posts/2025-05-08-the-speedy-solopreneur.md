In [The Batch 300](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-300/}, Andrew Ng shared some insights on the importance of speed for startups and how to be fast as a startup:

- focus on one concrete idea (don't hedge)
- quickly switch to a different hypthesis if data indicates the original hypothesis is flawed
- trust a domain expert's gut
- quickly build and test prototypes with AI assisted coding
- be fast at getting user feedback (this becomes the bottleneck and a competetive advantage)
- know the technology well (deep understanding of what AI can and cannot do well, saves wasting time in blind alleys)

I think they translate well to ideas for being a **speedy solopreneur**:

- Focus on one idea,
- vibe code prototypes,
- be creative at getting fast user feedback (doesn't have to scale),
- quickly pivot, but
- stay in your domain,
- use a KISS stack you know, and
- learn AI technology well.

Today, solopreneurs can move faster than ever before.
