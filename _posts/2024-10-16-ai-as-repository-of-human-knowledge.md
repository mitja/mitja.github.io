Yann LeCun has made an interesting statement in a talk he gave at a talk. I didn't find the original source, but here is a snippet from Twitter:

<video controls src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1846254874729582592/vid/avc1/720x720/cEG0uRC7I2v19Mcb.mp4?tag=16" type="video/mp4"></video>

Predictions aside, I think the realization that AI will become a repository of human knowledge is the real interesting take of this snippet - and the question whether it should be a product or open source:

"If we succeed in doing this, we're going to have systems, that really will mediate all of our interaction with the digital world. They will answer all of our questions, they will be with us at all times. They will basically constitute a repository of human knowledge. And this feel like an infrastructure kind of thing, like the internet. It's not like a product, it's more like an infrastructure. These AI platforms must be open source."

I agree.
