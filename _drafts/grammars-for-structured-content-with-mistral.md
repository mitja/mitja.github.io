This piece demonstrates how to use json schema and llama.cpp json schema to grammar to get Mistral 7B Instruct to parse and extract information in a structured way.

In simple terms: How to let Mistral 7B Instruct generate structured content (JSON etc.)

[llama.cpp](/docs/resources/tools/llama.cpp) has a feature to direct generations of text to grammars. This is more robust than using a parser-only approach as provided for example by [LangChain](/docs/resources/tools/langchain). This article describes, how to get structured content from Mistral 7B instruct using a dataclass, a json schema generated by PyLLMCore, and a grammar generated by llama.cpp.
