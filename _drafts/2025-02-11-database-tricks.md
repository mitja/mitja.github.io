- low downtime schema change: make a read replica, change schema, promote replica
- in-place schema change: pt-online-schema-change (for MySQL), or https://github.com/shayonj/pg-osc (for Postgres), or pgroll (https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) which does it on column level instead of table level as pg-osc does.
