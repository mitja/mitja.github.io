There are no licenses required for you or your users to utilize the Teams AI Library. Azure OpenAI and OpenAI both follow pay-as-you-go consumption pricing for you to use their large language models that will power the custom copilot you build.

When you build your own copilot, you create a dedicated conversational application using a large language model (LLM) and dialog manager combined with your organizationâ€™s knowledge, connectors to line-of-business applications, and your own custom topics. When you customize Copilot for Microsoft 365, you use a subset of Copilot Studio capabilities to extensions that act as skills within the LLM in Copilot for Microsoft 365.
 
Power Virtual Agents capabilities and features are now part of Copilot Studio following significant investments in generative AI and enhanced integrations across Copilot.
