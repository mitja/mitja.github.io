- AMD
  - top offer with 395+, 128 GB, strong CPU, ok-ish mem bandwidths
  - bigger: Epyc Genoa workstation (9374F)
  - epyc turing gen 5, a bit more than 4k, but expandable, and more versatile Epyc 9005 has 12 ram channels going up to 512 GB/s. I currently can't find an available mainboard with the correct board revision to support it though. 16 core CPU ~1.5k€, 192GB RAM (registered ecc) ~1.5k€, board ~1k€ You can even get a dual socket board and theoretically double the bandwidth (if you correctly pin your threads to the cores).
- Nvidia
  - digits, price so high, it makes Apple look reasonable, one alone?, 2 nice, speaking of
- Apple
  - M3 Ultra the best money can buy, but 10k is a lot
  - M4 Pro gets you 90%
- Intel
  - sad to say, but they are not in the game
