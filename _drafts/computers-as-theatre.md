When I started studying at the University of Arts, I loved strolling through their libaries which were tiny faculty libraries but very selective and discoverable. One day, I discovered a book that profoundly changed the way I think about designing and "reading" software: Brenda Laurel's "Computer as Theatre". This year, I re-read the book, the first and the second edtion and have to conclude: It's as applicable as ever and even more relevant than ever.

She started the first edition of her book with a quote from Donald A. Norman and - surprise! - a definition of agents:

"When we look toward what is known about the nature of interaction, why not turn to those who manage it best - to those of the world of drama, of the stage, of the theatre?" (Donald A. Norman, p. xii)

"agent to mean one who initiates action, a definition consistent with Aristotle's use of the concept Poetics.

She continues by arguing that theatre is a better lens to understand interaction design than psychology, since
in general, psychology attemts to describe what goes on in the real world with all its fuzziness and loose ends, while theatre attempts to represent something that might go on, simplified for the purpose of logical and affective clarity.

Her critique of the classical view is that it does not support action that integrates human agency but leaves the design to the author. In contrast the experience of interactivity is a "thresholdy" phenommen with a real issue: **"How can people participate as agents within representational contexts?"**

overlap: representing action with multiple agents.

much of what we see in TV or streaming is trivial content, impoverished range of points of view, diminish the human nature by diminishing what we think about and how we think about it.

Welcome to **the four causes**, or why things are the way they are:

- formal cause: the form or shape of what it is trying to be
- material cause: what is it made of; properties of material influence the properties of the thing
- efficient cause: the way in which it is actually made.
- end cause: its purpose, what is it intended to do in the world once it is completed?

applied to theatre:

- formal cause: completed plot, the whole action the playwright is trying to represent
- material cause: the stuff a play is made of, the enactment is the performance which enfolds before the eyes and ears of the audience; there is more to enactment than words, it's **the experience**
- efficient cause: the skills, tools, techniques of the playwrights, actors, and other actors who contribute to the finished play
- end cause: the pleasurable arousal and expression of a particular set of emotions in the audience (cathasis)

formal cause: inherently stochastic, not deterministic, a world on its own; formal cause is fragile; new forms of interaction - conversational that are a joy to use, a much improved genre, autonomous agents, a new genre? not completely

material cause: all things digital, code, pixels, waveforms, a model and the way it's prompted (directed) is a part of it. our participation can be more open-ended, we experience it and we experience our actions with it. cannot change fundamentally, in the end we are still human.

efficient cause: code, dev skills, data skills, all other kinds of skills, new skills, system capabilities already part - ever, in theatre, in comp games, models are just a new kind of skill or capability.

end cause: also both (arousal or xxx), the purpose. can be directed

Aristotle's model it is still applicable...



the **six qualitative elements** and **causal relations** among them:

**Action**

**Character**

**Thought**

"In his application of a theatrical analogy to the domain of artificial intelligence, Julian Hilton puts it this way: 'What the audience does is supply the inferencing engine which drives the plot, obeying Shakespeare's injunction to eke out the imperfections of the play (its incompleteness) with its mind. (Hilton, 1991)

p 57.

**"Can computers think? There is an easy answer: Computer-based agents, like dramatic characters, do not have to *think* (in fact there are many ways in which the cannot); the simply have to *provide a representation from which thought may be inferred*."**

true, it feels very much like it, I ...

2023 is 30 aniversary of the book. it is also the breaktrhough year of approachable AI, Generative AI, curious what we will see on its 40th or 50th aniversary. whatever this may be, if it's *for us*, the basic premises of Computers as Theatre will still hold.

**Language**, usually translated as diction

the expression of their (the caracters') thought in words

- much closer to original (drama the use of language, classic hci: selection and arrangement of signs, semiotically used symbolic representations) - it is a language but not a spoken human language. now the machine can speak, too.

**Melody (Pattern)** - the pleasurable perception of pattern in sensory phenomena.

**Spectacle (Enactment)** - sensory dimensions, orthodox view: spectacle is visible melody audible, but this is 


The Greeks employed **drama as tools for thought**.

Is there nothing new under the sun, since 400-500 BC?

Yes and no. *We* are still the same, we have just created ourselfs vastly different tools. The newness might distract from applying the basic, long-known and long proven principles. We can build on this, and we do good by looking at what we can learn from theatre, and drama and by looking at software in terms of drama - *software as drama*.

the qualitative elements are even closer to drama, than before, with llms playing characters.

As then, it is a treasure trove of inspiration. There are many untreaded roads, like melody (pattern)

Brenda Laurel's Computers as Theatre revolutionized the field of human-computer interaction. Her ideas certainly inspired many software and interaction designers, and I hope continue to inspire them for years to come. I think, Laurel's insights are that effective software design, like effective drama, must engage the user directly in an experience involving both thought and emotion. A practical conclusion I took from her book was that a user's enjoyment must be a central design consideration, and this demands a deep awareness of dramatic theory and technique, both ancient and modern. 

A conclusion I would add today is, that it's also important to look and and question the end cause of artifacts. What is it's purpuse? What do their authors intend to achieve with it? In the best case it's meant to be a tool for thought, to enlighten us as opposed to being devices of submission, control and power projection.

With Generative AI, software is changing forever. Artificial Agents become real, they will be 'things' "from which thought can be inferred". We can probably teach models to play theatre much better than they already do. Many avenues mapped by Laurel are still unchartered. But as models become better, another quesiton becomes even more important: What are they built for? What do they want to tell us? Or better: What does their author want to tell us? Or turned upside down: What do I as a creator what the agents to tell us. What's the purpose of *my* agents?

In 2013, 22 years after the first edition, Laurel has released a second version. In it, she reflected on enormous change and personal experience and forward toward emerging technologies and ideas that will transform human-computer interaction yet again. Beginning with a clear analysis of classical drama theory, Laurel explores new territory through the lens of dramatic structure and purpose. Computers as Theatre, Second Edition, is directed to a far wider audience, is written more simply and elegantly, is packed with new examples, and is replete with exciting and important new ideas.

Today, 22 years after the second editionl, I'd really love to learn what Brenda thinks about the recent raise of AI. I'd really love to read a third edition of "Computers as Theatre", written in 2025.


we have so many more means to act out a play

sw is eating the world. what kind of world do we want to come out the other end when it's done digesting?

evals is a special kind of quantitative research. it's part of the play. It's a way to learn and inform what touches, and imporove the act.

potentially micro-focussedn on one ind. player, with a high-speed loop like in TikTok's xxx architecture.
