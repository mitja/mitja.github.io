Aidan Mattrick:
00:26:50
@Hamel Husain thoughts on best practices on evals for subjectivity/nuances of chat-based applications and how that carries over to voice?
Sw yx:
00:26:54
story time:
one big surprise i had recently was that it is remarkably hard to get Instructor to spit out the function call traces. i had a really bad regression last week where suddenly GPT 4.1 just refused to put out array of size >1, so it kept failing the Instructor loop  repeatedly. i enabled Instructor debug mode, and it only tells you the inputs, but not the outputs that fail. so no idea how to fix.

They have very different styles that are arguably more “pythonic”, but in my short experience the retries mechanisms seemed more robust than instructor. ( @Sw yx )

Do we have time for more live demos of (production) examples? Real Coval clients in the wild?

Something like “does this AI sound like a human?” has not worked well for me even after trying several different prompt/LLM judger

Replying to "What I’ve seen is “t..."
“I’ve noticed a lot of people underestimate their own taste, because they expect having good taste to feel like being very smart or competent or good at things. Unfortunately, I am here to tell you that, at least if you are similar to me, you will never feel smart, competent, or good at things; instead, you will just start feeling more and more like everyone else mysteriously sucks at them.
For this reason, the prompt I suggest here is: what does it seem like everyone else is mysteriously bad at? That’s probably a sign that you have good taste there.

I see your point -potentially important to break this down into several categories like “no stage direction”, “no explicit reference of being LLM or text based language model”, etc

Potentially what’s hard is LLM speech pattern, e.g. LLM like to be super verbose and going around about repeating some phrases

Feels like we are still in Potter Stewart era “I know it when I see it”
