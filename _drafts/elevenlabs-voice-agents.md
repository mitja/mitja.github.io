Building a voice agent with elevenlabs 

https://elevenlabs.io/de/conversational-ai

In terms of latency they seem to benefit from the speech component running very close to everything else. 

They have delivered the lowest latencies I have seen amongst e2e competition (EU perspective)

11labs with flash 2.5 model works quite well, also your mentioned rime and Cartesia, but you'll have to decide yourself, it depends on what eatures you need, which sounds best for you, etc.

in-house built turn detection, very good, comparison to https://github.com/pipecat-ai/smart-turn would be interesting

vendor lock-in, unfortunately not usable with PipeCat.

eleven labs background noise cancellation seemed magic to me. 
Pipecat: That background noise reduction is a model from Krisp.
